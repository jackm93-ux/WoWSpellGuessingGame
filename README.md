# WoWSpellGuessingGame

This is a simple spell icon guessing game from world of warcraft as a learning project for javascript.

This prohect is a demonstration of the best practices for DOM and javaqscript at a beginner level as I am learning from the udemy javascript course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 

The icons are retrieved from https://wow.zamimg.com/ which is the image host for the popular world of warcraft website wowhead.

I made/did this exercise after roughly 4-6 weeks of learning Javascript and wanted to take those first anxious steps to making something of my own, mainly expanding my understanding of css and javascript generally beyond courses.

To see the website in action follow this link: https://jackm93-ux.github.io/WoWSpellGuessingGame/ you will most likely need to clear your browser cache if an update has been implemented as Git pages seem to refer to the cached version and don't update the pages immediately.
